# What?

Refactor js-idm-wallet in Svelte, deployed to vercel now.

This repo implements the streamlined-idm-wallet-SDK uisng svelte and sapper.

# Why?

I love [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) as it's so compact and easy. However, I couldn't get IPFS to work with Rollup on [Sapper](https://sapper.svelte.dev/docs/), so I needed to stick to Webpack. I found it was pretty hard to get the right webpack config to get IPFS running. Once I found the rght magic formula, decided to save it here.

Now you can benefit from it too!
